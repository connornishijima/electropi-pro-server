!---- 12/02/14 ElectroPi 1.1! Whew! While we had a few bumps during launch with the device
tracking features, it's been awesome! Now available as a working feature is WeMo support!
Once any WeMo Switch is set up on your home WiFi, it will automatically populate on the
ElectroPi control screen! EPi's control_watch.py will refresh the available switches now
and then, and keep track of their states! If you turn one on with the WeMo app, it's on
inside ElectroPi. Turn it off with ElectroPi, and it's off in WeMo.

Not that you'd ever use their app again. ;)
