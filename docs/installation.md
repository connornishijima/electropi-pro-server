#Installing the ElectroPi Server#

Thank you for making ElectroPi your choice for Home Automation! Let's begin.

###WGET the installer###

This is the powerhouse that will be in charge of control codes, appliances, device tracking and more. ElectroPi can be installed with two commands:

```bash
$ sudo wget http://connor-n.com/electropi/ep_install.py
$ sudo python ep_install.py
```

Immediately you will be greeted with an ElectroPi intro screen, and you can begin the installation.

###PERSONALIZATION###

During this installation your Pi will prompt you for a few questions to help tailor your experience. They are as follows:

#####Do you want to wipe the '/var/www' Apache2 directory?#####
If you already have a web server installed, answer "N". Otherwise, the installer will wipe the '/var/www' directory clean.

#####Configure Timezone#####
This will have you select your timezone for control scheduling purposes.

#####Will this Pi be WiFi-based?#####
If so, the installer will ask your for your WiFi credentials so the Pi can join the your wireless network.

#####Enter the IP address to assign to ElectroPi#####
This is the address at which you can access the ElectroPi control screen to switch your appliances. This is a "static" IP address - meaning that once set no other networked device can take it's address. Ex: `192.168.1.88`

#####Enter your Netmask#####
Check with your network administrator for this value. Most home networks are Class-C netmasks, so `255.255.255.0` will almost always work.

#####Enter your router's IP#####
This is the router's IP address, or "gateway". Depending on the brand of router (or personal settings) this is either `192.168.1.0` or `192.168.1.1`. Test both IP addresses in a browser to see which one is yours. If a user/password appears, that's probably your router.
