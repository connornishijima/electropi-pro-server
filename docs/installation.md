This is the powerhouse that will be in charge of control codes, appliances, device tracking and more. ElectroPi can be installed with two commands:

```
$ sudo wget http://connor-n.com/electropi/ep_install.py

Immediately you will be greeted with an ElectroPi intro screen, and you can begin the installation.
