				Because I still handle all of the soldering, hardware/software design and customer support, I'm thinking a 70/30 split for this batch. We can get that closer to 50/50 if you want to develop/support for me as well in the future. With a split like that, you net $348.00 at $36.25/hour for only 9.6 hours of work over the duration of selling the batch. Some people will even order two at a time, making that shipment only take 12 minutes of so and earn you twice as much. When I put the first ElectroPi to market, I did a batch of 21 boards on release, and did it in two weeks. I sold 78 more before stopping in December. We can do this, it's easy.<br>
				<br>
				After this batch, I'm looking into another batch of 150. With a 50/50 split it would earn you over $1,500 for less than 45 hours of work. Selling 3 boards a day (average) means the batch is done in one month. $1,500 every month. You'd be making $18 THOUSAND dollars a year on your own. And in total - you'd only be working 22.5 days a year. 342 days of vacation. If we double efforts we each make $36,000 a year, 320 days of vacation. Want to make $72,000 a year?<br>
				<br>
				You'd still have 275 days worth of vacation.

				Each costs $12.95 to make. That's everything from the PCB to the components, to the box it goes out in. Each sells for $35, making the profit out of each board a total $22.04 in-pocket.<br>
				<br>

				Once done, they each take about 10 minutes each to package, label, record and ship. Doing 5 boards per day, that's 50 minutes - leaving you 5 minutes to the post office, 5 min back. (The time it takes to ship each package is included in their 10 minutes' time.) 5 a day, totalling one hour of solid work a day.
